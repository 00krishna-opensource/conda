===================================
Improving interoperability with pip
===================================

To improve the interoperability between conda and pip,
conda 4.6.0 added preview support. With this interoperability,
conda can use pip-installed packages to satisfy dependencies,
cleanly remove pip-installed software, and replace them with
conda packages when appropriate.

If youâ€™d like to try the feature, you can set this ``.condarc`` setting::

   conda config --set pip_interop_enabled True

Even without activating this feature, conda now understands pip metadata
more intelligently. For example, if we create an environment with conda::
   
   conda create -y -n some_pip_test python=3.7 imagesize=1.0

Then we update imagesize in that environment using pip::

   conda activate some_pip_test
   pip install -U imagesize

Prior to conda 4.6, the ``conda list`` command returned ambiguous results::

   imagesize                 1.1.0

   imagesize                 1.0.0 py37_0

Conda 4.6 now shows only one entry for imagesize (the newer pip entry)::
 
   imagesize                 1.1.0 pypi_0    pypi
